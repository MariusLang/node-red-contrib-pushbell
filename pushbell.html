    <h3><span style="color: #007AFF;">Getting Started</span></h3>
    <h4><span style="color: #007AFF;">PushBell app setup</span></h4>
    <p>If you already have an PushBell account, all you need to do is sign in. You can locate your existing API keys
        under the <em>Settings > Manage API keys</em> section. Otherwise, please follow the instructions below.</p>
    <p>To get started, download the PushBell app from the App Store. After installation, go ahead and create your own
        PushBell account. To create an API key, just follow the instructions given or go to <em>Settings > Manage API
            keys</em>and select <b>Generate API key</b>. Before that, you need to pick an appropriate name for the API
        key. The name you choose is up to you. It's simply helpful for you to identify your API keys at a later time.
    </p>
    <h4><span style="color: #007AFF;">PushBell Node RED setup</span></h4>
    <p>Then initialize the node by using your API key. To do this, create a PushBell configuration node and initialize
        it with your API key. In the configuration node, you can also choose a name for the API key. The name you choose
        is up to you. It's simply necessary for you to identify your API key configuration nodes at a later time.</p>
    <p>To create notifications send the payload described below to the node's input.</p>
    <h3><span style="color: #007AFF;">Node Input</span></h3>
    <code>msg.payload = { title: "My Notification Title", description: "My Notification Description" }</code>
    <h3><span style="color: #007AFF;">Node Status</span></h3>
    <h4><span style="color: #007AFF;">Green</span></h4>
    <p>If you see a green dot and a message that says <code>200 Notification successfully
        created</code>, it means everything went smoothly. Your notification has been sent to the PushBell server and
        the smartphones connected to your account.</p>
    <h4><span style="color: #007AFF;">Blue</span></h4>
    <p>If you see a blue ring and a message that says <code>sending</code>, it means that the node-red-contrib-pushbell
        node is attempting to create a notification. In a few seconds, this status should change to either red or green.
    </p>
    <h4><span style="color: #007AFF;">Red</span></h4>
    <p>If you see a red dot, it indicates an error occurred while creating a notification. To obtain more
        information, refer to the message provided next to the status badge.
    </p>
    <p>Common errors status codes are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>401 Unauthorized</code> - Something went wrong with the authorization process. Please check your API
            key configuration and try again.
        </li>
        <li><code>429 Requests exceeded for today</code> - The number of notifications you can send per day is limited.
            It seems that this limit has been exceeded. For more information, please refer to the information provided
            in the PushBell app.
        </li>
        <li><code>400 Bad Request</code> - Check the payload you send to the node-red-contrib-pushbell node. It appears
            that there may be something wrong with your input body. In the section Node Input you will find additional
            information on how your input payload should be formatted.
        </li>
        <li><code>500 Request failed</code> - If you come across this error, please check your node configuration and
            attempt to create a notification again. If you encounter this error once more, feel free to contact us.
        </li>
